# Scraper: a URL scraper for static assets

# System Requirements
- python 2.7
- pip
- virtualenv

# Dependencies
Developers modify the `user-requirements.txt`file to add or update new deps.
After modifying, be sure to run:

```
pip install -r user-requirements.txt && pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

That will save everything into the requirements.txt file but won't be very
user-readable. Think of this as the difference between Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
for anyone with Ruby experience.
